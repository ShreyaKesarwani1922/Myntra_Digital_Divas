# Myntra Homepage Redesign for Gen Z

## Overview

This project involves the redesign of Myntra's homepage to better appeal to the Gen Z demographic. The redesigned layout features style and trend-wise categorization instead of the traditional brand-centric approach. This shift aims to enhance user engagement and create a more intuitive and visually appealing shopping experience.

## Problem Statement

The current homepage layout of Myntra is predominantly brand-centric, which does not resonate well with the Gen Z demographic. This generation values style, trends, and quality over brand names. The existing categorization is outdated and fails to capture the dynamic and ever-evolving fashion preferences of young shoppers. Consequently, this hampers user engagement and the ability to attract and retain Gen Z and newer audiences.

## Objective

The primary objective of this redesign is to enhance user engagement and appeal to the Gen Z demographic. This is achieved by:
- Redesigning the homepage layout to feature style and trend-wise categorization.
- Showcasing fashion pieces relevant to popular styles and trends such as Boho, Barbiecore, Korean Fashion, Monochromatic, Chic Office Wear, Party Wear, and more.
- Creating a more intuitive and visually appealing shopping experience that aligns with the preferences of the younger audience.
